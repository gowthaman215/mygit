class 1: Computer Programming Language
======================================

1. Programming langues are simlar to human speaking language. but difference is computer programing language are using 
to interact with computer hardware.

Computer programming language is software thing used to interact with computer hardware.

Purpose of computer programming language is to make computer hardware to perform some task


Types of computer programming languages
=====================================

1. High Level Language or Human understandable Programming languages such as c, c++, java, python, html, .net..etc
2. Low Level Language or - Assembly Language(Object code or assembler output) 
3. machine level Language - Binary language or 0s and 1s combination (executable code)


Life cycle of C programming
=================================================================================

Source code

     |
  Compilation (compiler)
     |
     V

Object Code

     |
  Linking  (Linker)
     |
     V

Executable code (Machine code or runnable code)

     |
   Interpretation (Interpreter)
     |
     V
Invocation of Hardware.

=========================================================================================


source code
===========


set of High level programming language instructions is known as source code.

Example:

test.c
======

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Hello World");
}



Object code or assembly code
============================

object codes are assembly code or intermediate code represented as simple instruction sets

Example:

Live Demo
section	.text
   global _start     ;must be declared for linker (ld)
	
_start:	            ;tells linker entry point
   mov	edx,len     ;message length
   mov	ecx,msg     ;message to write
   mov	ebx,1       ;file descriptor (stdout)
   mov	eax,4       ;system call number (sys_write)
   int	0x80        ;call kernel
	
   mov	eax,1       ;system call number (sys_exit)
   int	0x80        ;call kernel

section	.data
msg db 'Hello, world!', 0xa  ;string to be printed
len equ $ - msg     ;length of the string


Executable code or machine code
===============================

Executable code are exactly binary code. that is combination of 0s and 1s.

Exampe:

1100111001110000 1111100000001000 011111000011111

0011000111110001 1100000111001110 001100111100100 


Compiler
========

compilar is a software program which converts source code to object code(assembler output code)

Linker
======

Linker is software prorgram which link all dependency files code into a single executable file.


Interpreter
===========

Interpreter is a software program which executes the instructions from the executable file.




Class 2: Programming things
===========================

Bit - Either 0 or 1 is known as a bit. 
Byte - combination of 8 bits is known as byte. example 0001 0010
data - Raw facts is known as data
information - Processed data is known as Information.

Binary Number - 0 , 1
Octal Number - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Decimal number - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
hexa decimal number - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F

Algorithm - step by step instructions is known as an Algorithm which is represented as simple english sentences.
Pseudo code - step by step instructions represented by symbols and shorhand for a command
flow chart - pictorial representation(picture form) of an algoritham is known as flow chart.
UML - unified Modeling language (set of diagrams to determine larger program code)

Token - Basic unit of a programming language
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-tokens/

Keywords - keywords are reserved words which gives special meaning in a program

c defines 32 keywords

auto         double      int        struct
break        else        long       switch
case         enum        register   typedef
char         extern      return     union
const        float       short      unsigned
continue     for         signed     void
default      goto        sizeof     volatile
do           if          static     while

c++ defines 31 keyword

asm          bool        catch          class
const_cast   delete      dynamic_cast   explicit 
export       false       friend         inline 
mutable      namespace   new            operator 
private      protected   public         reinterpret_cast
static_cast  template    this           throw
true         try         typeid         typename 
using        virtual     wchar_t 

*Keywords should not be used as an identifier.


Identifiers - Identifiers are any name given to a variable or function.
Constants - contants are any fixed value. those values will never change in a program.
Strings - Group of characters is known as string.
          Group of letters,numbers, symbols and operators forms a string. example: "Exskjdnjakdfak092287013)((&'';;p"
          string value should always denoted within double quotes in C program.
Charactor - single letter is known as character. In C/C++ character value should always denoted within single quote. example: 'a','1',':','Q','`'
Special Symbols - special characters except albhaphets, numbers are known as special symbols. examples:  ,.;"'{}[]()~!#&|%
Operators - Operators are special charactors which tells compiler to operform arithmetical and logical operation. example: +,-,*,/,%,<,>,<=,>=,!=
Preprocessor directives - special word which always begins  with #(hash symbol). example #include , #define, #ifdef, ifndef,#else, #elseif




Identifying tokens in below program
==================================

#include<stdio.h>  
int main()    
{    
 int i,fact=1,number;    
 printf("Enter a number: ");    
  scanf("%d",&number);    
    for(i=1;i<=number;i++){    
      fact=fact*i;    
  }    
  printf("Factorial of %d is: %d",number,fact);    
return 0;  
}   


Preprocessor directives:
========================
#include,

Keywords:
=========

int,
return,
for,

Symbol:
======
<>
()
{}
,
;

identifier:
===========

stdio.h - header file name
main - function name
printf - function name
scanf - function name
i - variable

number

operators
=========
=
++
<=
*

string
========
"Enter a number: " - string constant
"%d" - formate string
"Factorial of %d is: %d" - string
