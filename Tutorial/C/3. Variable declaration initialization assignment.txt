   Variable Declaration
   ====================
   
   Desc:
   
   during variable declaration compilar/interpreter will create memory location for the variable.
   
   Syntax:
   
   <Datatype> [space] <list of variable name separated my comma> ;
   
   
   Datatypes:
   
   char, int, float,  double
   
   Modifier/Qualifier data types:
   
   short, long, signed, unsigned
   
   Example:
   
   int age;
   char gender;
   float pi,  height, weight, area;
   double pi;
   
   Notes:
   
   compilar = sourcecode to object code
   interpreter = obj to binary code (executable code)
   
   programmer can understand source code
   hardware machain can understand binary code.
   
   source -> compiler -> object code -> interpreter -> executable machine code

     Variable Initialization
     =======================
     
     Desc:
     
     variable initialization is a process of creating memory and storing value of the memory as well.
   
     Syntax:
     
     <Datatype> [space] <variable_name> = value(const/variable) ;
     
     Example:
     
     float pi=3.14;
     
     variable initialization is a process of creating memory and storing value of the memory as well.
