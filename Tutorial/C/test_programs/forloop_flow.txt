=======================

step 1. interpreter reads initializtion statement and executes it.
step 2. interpreter reads conditional statment and executes it.
step 3. if the condition is true then interpreter reads set of for-loop statements and executes it.  
       
     3.1. interpreter reads increment/decrement statement and executes it at the end of for loop.
     3.2. interpreter executes again from step 2
