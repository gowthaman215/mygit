/*

1. What is fact?

2. what is Data?

    1. Raw fact

    Example: Sun, East, 18, Male, Oviya, oviya.venkatesan@gmail.com, 29/12/2001

What is Information?


    Processed data is known as information.
    Example: Sun rises at east.

what is an Input?

1. Any Information is provided or given to the computer or any electronic device is considered as input.
2. in other words, when a computer or device is receiving a command or signal from outer sources, the event is referred to as input to the device.
3. Device used to perform input operation is known as Input Device.

Example: Keyboad, mouse, touch pannel, virtual keyboard(software interface used for input)

what is an output?

1. Any information that is processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered as output.
2. Device used to perform output operation is known as Output Device.

Example: Monitor, Printer, Fax etc


Handline Input/output operation in C
====================================

1. C programming provides mechanism to handle input and output operations through input and output functions.

2. a Function in comuter programming is a set of instruction to perform specific task  or work.

3. Input fuction : function user for input operation is known as input function.


1. scanf(), 

syntax
======

scanf("format string", reference of variable);


example
=======

scanf("%d", &age);
scanf("%d %d",&age1,&age2);

%d - integer
%f - float
%c - character
%s - string


2. sscanf(),
3. gets(),
4. fgets(),
5. getc(),
6. getch()







4. Output function : function user for output operation is known as output function.

1. printf()
============

syntax:
======

printf("format string", list of varible name);


example:
========

printf("My age is %d\n", age);




sprintf(),
puts(),
fputs(),
putc()

*/



Exercise
=========


1. write a C program to get integer value as your age and print your age on console/screen.

2.
